# Responsive-Portfolio
Using bootstrap and media queries I recreated my bootstrap portfolio to try and make it as mobile responsive and viewable as possible.  The most diffucult part was using the media queries and the CSS I did not know the last one wins in CSS and at first was putting my media queries at the top which was messing everything up.  Although I did not do the best job on this it really helped me learn and understand CSS and how to use it.  This is somewhat mobile responsive my footer was being a pain and I could not get it to work as well as I wanted it to with that being said if you want to see a really good mobile responsive and responsive site go check out my "Basic Portfolio" repo there it has a link to view my portfolio and it looks much better then this one.
